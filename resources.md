## Technical Resources 

AR.js (seems simple and easy to navigate)
    - Used for web-based augmented reality development 
    - documentation: https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/, github orginization: https://github.com/AR-js-org
        - location based AR: using a location to display AR content (seems useful for the real)
            - project: https://medium.com/swlh/build-your-location-based-augmented-reality-web-app-a841956eed2c   
        - marker tracking: using a marker (picture) that displays AR content when shown to a camera
            - project: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIXJJoqM8BQ 

OpenCV Library
    - create and AR environment using a users computer camera 
    - the OpenCV library can help to access a user's camera and perform computer vision tasks 
    - According to this article https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application-development/9781785280948/1/ch01lvl1sec10/what-can-you-do-with-opencv, OpenCV can:
        - detect objects
        - analyze shapes 
        - track movement
        - face and object recognition 
        - depth mapping  
    - library documentation: https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/
        - important to note that there is openCV-Python for Python and openCV.js for Javascript

OpenCV.js
    - helpful for face recognition 
    - host a website with js and html that displays the user's camera (create a face filter maybe) 
    - tutorial on how to use openCV.js to track face
    

## Artistic/Design/Aesthetic Resources

Project Ideas:
    - Marker based augmented reality (card or qr code AR):

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRY6iuGkKBM (at 11:33 demonstrates an AR business card)

    - location based AR (e.g., Pokemon GO or Augmented Reality that helps navigation)
